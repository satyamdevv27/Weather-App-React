# 🌦️ Weather App with 5-Day Forecast Slider

A sleek and responsive weather app built with React.js that provides real-time weather updates and a 5-day forecast. This project demonstrates the use of APIs, React state management, and `react-slick` for creating a dynamic and visually appealing forecast slider.
